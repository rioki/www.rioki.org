title: "CatLight"

I was looking for a simple and good build notification tray icon for [Team Foundation Server][1] and I think I just found it: [CatLight][2]

Cat light is a [commercial usable freeware][3] (not open source / free software) of uncertain providence. The website catlight.io is has no clear attribution to a person or company. Also a whois request only brings up the company WhoisGuard Inc. in Panama. (Suspicions!)

The software is appealing in it's simplicity. It key feature is the tray icon:

<img src="/media/catlight/screen-tray-yellow.png" class="img-responsive">
<img src="/media/catlight/screen-tray-red.png" class="img-responsive">

If something happens, you get nice toast nonfictions:

If you want to know what the status of the individual builds is, you can double click the icon and you get the status dashboard:

<img src="/media/catlight/screen-dashboard.png" class="img-responsive">

And that is all the there is to the application. Simple and does what it
should.
