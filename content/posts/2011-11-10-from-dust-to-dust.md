Nice tech demo, where is the game? 

Having compleated some significant work, I treated myself to a game that I wanted
to try out for a long time, [From Dust][1]. It basically all sttlarted with the 
first "Dev Diary" video. A beautyfull landscape molded in real time with reatime
simulation of water, fire and vegetation. A real technology gem.

I heard allot of the game and few reviews where positive. But god games where
never very popular, so in this case reviews are not the gold standard. I got the
game [via steam][2] and tried it out. 

The first thing that greeted me was the ubisoft launcher, that required me to
create an account. Really, an account for a pure single player game?! Nice
anoying DRM scheme, you know Steam has one and it works without anoying you. 
Next the launcher whent through the hoops of updating the game 3 times. 
Seriously?! Why did they not put the latest version of the game on steam?! What
did I need to download then anyway?! Once I got over these DRM induced anoyances
I was able to play the game. 

The game puts you in the position of "the breath", a godly presence that can 
scoop up sand, water and lava. It is your task to colonise an area by sending 
people to visalges marked by totem poles. Each vilage will grand you a specific
special power, such as jellyfying water, so you can pull a [moses stunt][3].

The game is beautifull and the simulation is crisp. The only visual snatch are
the simulation boundaries. They put some effort into hiding them, but they still
are quite noticable.

But all in all, the game is a terain editor on steroids. Although interesting 
and sometimes chalanging the game is not really fun. It is nice to see that such
technology works, but this is not really a game, more a tech demo. On the other 
hand I payed 15 EUR for it, you can't really complain.
