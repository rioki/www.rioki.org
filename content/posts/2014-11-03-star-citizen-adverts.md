One aspect of [Star Citizen][1]'s marketing is genius, the [ship adverts][2].

When you are marketing a game it is really difficult. What do you tell the 
potential players? More graphics, more spaceships awesome fun? Pulling this
off is really hard, without coming over as a cheesy use care sales pitch. 
The best so far are the cinematic trailers, but these are often lauded for 
their lack of actual game footage.

In contrast the Star Citizen's ship adverts are a pure strike of genius. 
Although technically speaking they are "just" a cinematic trailer, but 
they interact with the audience in a different way. In no point is it mentioned 
that a game called Star Citizen exists; they are designed to appeal to actual 
(functional) 30th century potential ship buyers. The result is that they 
fell authentic without having the "meh, it's just a cinematic trailer" vibe.

But finally the master piece is the Top Gear reimagining of Galactic Gear. The 
brilliance is not only marketing, entertainment.

Was this a post that sole purpose was to embed the awesome trailers? 
I am not telling.
