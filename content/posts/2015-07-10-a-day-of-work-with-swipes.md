So I [was asked][1] what my routine was? Well I wanted to write this post for a 
good while now, so here it is.

I am one of the people who [consider to do lists harmful][2]. So I start my 
day thinking about the pig picture things I want to do today. Commonly I do this
over a cup of espresso and today I want to clean up the house, since
Friday is may "day off" from my day job and continue working on [fedz.me][3], 
specificity I want to finish porting it to [angular.js][4].

At this point I look into [Swipes][5]. This morning the list looked like this:

I sort and schedule the tasks. Basically the tasks come in 3 ways, things I 
intend to do immediate, things I want to do "later today" and things I want to
do "tomorrow". (Occasionally I also push them off to "next weekend" or 
"next week".)

> **Tomorrow**

Today the list remained with only two items, with a further 2 waiting in 
"later today". Also what's not on the list are minor tasks from "cleaning up
house", anything about my work on fedz.me and the fact that I need to make a 
pizza dough, because my daughter comes in for lunch and I promised pizza. 

This approach of fist looking at the big picture and then extract actionable 
tasks comes from the time I rigorously made a productivity plan each morning. 
[This is something I learned from a jumping jack on coffee, that desperately 
tries to appear "professional" and fails at it.][6]

So after cleaning the house and Pizza, my list looks like such:

<img src="/media/ontop/swipes3.png" class="img-responsive">

After an other espresso I fire up my text editor and command line and start 
hacking away at fedz.me. Normally I would also track my progress with 
[Pivotal Tracker][7], like in [my review I wrote a while ago][8]. But fedz.me
it to much of a prototype to profit from project management.

At the end of the day, I have not checked my IAM policies and getting black ink
is a task for "tomorrow".

Like I wrote in my [review of swipes][9], I keep all the little loose ends in 
Swipes, not the big things and I don't use it for project management. In addition
I have a strict policy of deleting any task that I reschedule to often.

The reason why Swipes is awesome, is that it hides all the tasks you don't want
to do today anyway and thus you don't get guilt ridden by your to do list. This 
makes Swipes compatible with my aversion of to do lists. 

A final mention of awesomeness:

You can define what "weekend" means. This is awesome, because for me weekend 
means Friday, since I send Monday to Thursday working for my day job 
at Siemens. (I don't and can't use Swipes at Siemens.)
