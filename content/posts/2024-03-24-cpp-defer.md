# C++ Defer

In the development of C++ applications, especially those interfacing with 
C-style APIs, managing resources efficiently while ensuring exception safety 
can be challenging. To address this, I wrote a Zig-inspired defer construct, 
offering a practical solution for scenarios where implementing a 
full RAII wrapper is deemed excessive.

The defer construct is designed as follows:

```cpp
namespace stdex
{
    class defer
    {
    public:
        defer(const std::function<void ()>& fun) noexcept
        : fun(fun) {}

        ~defer()
        {
            if (fun)
            {
                fun();
            }
        }

        void cancel() noexcept
        {
            fun = {};
        }

    private:
        std::function<void ()> fun;

        defer(const defer&) = delete;
        defer& operator = (const defer&) = delete;
    };
}
```

This implementation ensures that resources are cleaned up automatically when 
the scope is exited, regardless of whether the exit is due to normal completion 
or an exception. To use the defer construct, a defer object is declared in the 
same scope as the resource it is managing. Upon scope exit, the specified lambda 
function is executed, performing the necessary cleanup.

For example, in the context of OpenGL shader management:

```cpp
OpenGLShader::OpenGLShader(const std::map<ShaderType, std::string>& shaders)
{
    auto vertex_id   = compile_shader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER,   shaders.at(ShaderType::VERTEX));
    auto d1 = stdex::defer([&](){ glDeleteShader(vertex_id); });

    auto fragment_id = compile_shader(GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER, shaders.at(ShaderType::FRAGMENT));
    auto d2 = stdex::defer([&](){ glDeleteShader(fragment_id); });

    program_id       = link_program({vertex_id, fragment_id});
}
```

There may be situations where the managed resource needs to be returned or kept 
alive beyond the current scope. In such cases, the defer construct offers a cancel 
method, allowing the deferred function to be bypassed and preventing it from 
executing.

```cpp
glm::uint compile_shader(GLenum type, const std::string& code)
{
    auto shader = glCreateShader(type);
    auto d = stdex::defer([&](){ glDeleteShader(shader); });

    auto c_code = code.data();
    auto c_size = static_cast<GLint>(code.size());

    glShaderSource(shader, 1, &c_code, &c_size);
    glCompileShader(shader);

    int success;
    glGetShaderiv(shader, GL_COMPILE_STATUS, &success);
    if (!success)
    {
        auto log = getGetShaderInfoLogEx(shader);
        throw std::runtime_error(tfm::format("Failed to compile shader: %s", log));
    }

    d.cancel();
    return shader;
}
```

The defer construct provides a simple yet effective mechanism for managing 
resources and ensuring exception safety, particularly in contexts where the 
se of full RAII patterns is impractical or unnecessary.
