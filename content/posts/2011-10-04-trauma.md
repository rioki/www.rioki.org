I bought [the humble frozen synapse bundle][1]. The main reason I bought it was 
for [Frozen Synapse][2]. I had heard allot about that game and what can you do
wrong with pay what you want? But what I think of Frozen Synapse is a different
story; what really surprised me was [Trauma][3].

Trauma is an award winning game and really merits these awards. (In contrast to
blueberry garden.) Normally I do not give much for awards in general and the 
game completely passed me by and is a real gem.

Traumatized by a car accident a young woman finds herself in hospital. Four
dreams describe her turmoil and you need to help her resolve them.

The game is a modern take on the classical still frame puzzle game. The graphics
are altered still images that cleanly blend reality with fiction and the visual 
impression is stunning. Especially the animations that take the realistic 
environment and completely destroy and alter it.

The only irritation I had where the obviously German environment and German 
accent in the main character's voice. But I think that is a personal miss trait.

Although the game is short, it does not feel short coming. It is worth picking 
up. Check out the [authors site][3] or get it in the [Humble Bundle][1], while it still 
lasts.
