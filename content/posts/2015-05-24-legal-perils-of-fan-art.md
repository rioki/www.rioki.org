After reading yet an other misinformed opinion on the legal status of fan art, 
I want to clear up the station a bit.

If you are creating fan art, you are violating up to three areas of the law. 
These are copyright law, trademark law and personality rights.

Copyright Law
-------------

[Copyright][cl] law grants the author or rights holder exclusive control over the 
work of art. This includes characters, items and locations and thus most fan 
art is affected.

Although copyright law grants authors of derived works (works using parts of / 
based upon other works) control on the derived work, but only if it was legal 
to create it. So any claim of fan art (unless you have a license for the original 
work) is null and void, including the bits you added.

There is one exemption, fair use. The fair use doctrine within copyright law is 
intended to allow satire and critique. Unfortunately, most fan art is not fair 
use.

The second exemption is public domain. These are works of art where the copyright 
has expired or never where under copyright. For example using characters from 
Shakespeare or pictures from NASA is OK.

Trademark Law
-------------

*Jack Daniels and Broken Piano for President*

[Trademark law][tl] protects marks, slogans, fonts and colors. [For example you can not 
create a book cover that looks like the Jack Daniels label][jd].

But the protection is not absolute, you can reference marks and slogans where it 
its into context. For example letting your character go to a Mc Donald's and 
being annoyed of the slogan "I am loving it." is ok, But creating a dystopian 
future where Mc Donald's takes over the world is not.

The point is that it should not create the illusion that the company owning the 
mark endorses your work or the image of the mark is severely damaged.

Personality Rights
------------------

Everybody has [personality rights][pr], such as the right to privacy and the 
right to control the use of one's image and likeness. This becomes an issue when 
writing fan fiction including famous people. Fortunately, so called people of 
public interest have a reduced personality rights. This is the legal basis on 
which it is OK to take pictures of celebrities is public places.

In respect to fan fiction, it is OK to let George Clooney turn up in your fan 
fiction on the red carpet of the Academy Awards, but the romantic episode that 
ensures is not.

Fan Fiction Still Exists
------------------------

But if fan fiction is badically illegal, how come that so much exists? 

There is a long tradition of tolerating non comertial fan fiction. After all it 
is the ultimate fan worship. But this is the only basis on which fan art may exist, 
with the permission of the rights holder. For example J.K. Roling or Marissa Mayer 
are not amused by fan art and have suppressed everything they could find. 
Fan art can not survive a legal challenge.

The only recourse is to create an original work. This does not mean you can not 
take some inspiration from other works, you just must ensure that it is sufficiently
different. For example 50 Shades of Gray is not a Twilight fan fiction, even 
though the main characters are inspired by it.
