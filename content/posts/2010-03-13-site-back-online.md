After some downtime the site is back online, but content is still 
missing in many places. 

My "old" server decided to go AWOL last Wednesday. The server did not 
come back up after some planed maintenance on the buildings power 
system. Since the server ran flawless for about five years and a 99% 
uptime guarantee, they still have 18.25 days to fix the problem. 
Although they promised to fix the problem as fast as possible, it seems 
other people have similar issues. 

The site is back up on a different server. This is because I was planing 
on moving the site to a cheaper (and newer) virtual server. The new 
server was ready on Tuesday and I was planing to move all my sites next 
week or so. Well now I booted by schedule up a bit. 

Since I wanted to make changes on Rioki's Corner and merge some almost 
obsolete sites into mine. The roll out of Rioki's Corner took a bit 
longer than expected.
