The [Star Wars: Rogue One][1] trailer is out and it looks really interesting. 
It's a movie that I did not really anticipate. Chronologically it is set just 
slightly before the events of [A New Hope][2] and focuses on the events that 
lead the theft of the Death Star plans.

But the odd and interesting spectacle was the showdown that ensured. My twitter
feed exploded into "Yay! A female lead!"

Oddly I had to actually look for the aforementioned tweets and few to little 
where to be found.

So yes, the trailer passes the [Bechdel test][3], it has a strong lead female 
and a strong black character of uncertain importance. That is awesome; not that
I care about these things specifically, but I like the character design. 

And yet most of the key lines are delivered by men and all extras literally are 
white and male. This is it a not major breakthough for women, there have been 
quite a good number of good movies with strong women, but it's not even the first 
Star Wars movie with a strong female protagonist.

The cognitive dissonance is strong in these people.
