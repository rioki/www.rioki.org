Modern variants of OpenGL are awesome and powerful, but when working on small 
OpenGL demos and test projects the simplicity of OpenGL's immediate mode is 
unbeatable. Unfortunately since OpenGL 3.0 there is no immediate mode rendering
anymore.

When toying around with some effects I decided to write a small library that 
implements the OpenGL immediate mode transformations. It is written in C and 
needs nothing more.

You can get the library over at github: https://github.com/rioki/glt
