I recently got into an argument, by clamming that the new HBO mini series 
Chernobyl was modern propaganda. The counter was, I could not evaluate this
since I had not yet seen it. The series seems really interesting and well made,
and I just have not yet found a legal way to watch it in Germany.
But I assert, that this dramatized not quite documentary is propaganda, even 
if they remain true to the real events and facts. I give Chernobyl the benefit 
of the doubt, even though I have grounds to believe that they 
got [some facts wrong][1].

The problem here is that most have an antiquated idea about how propaganda
looks like and feels. It is true that when I hear the word propaganda I first 
think about World War II style obvious [propaganda][4]. 

As Wikipedia puts it:

> Propaganda is information that is not objective and is used primarily to 
> influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts 
> selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using 
> loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to 
> the information that is presented. Propaganda is often associated with 
> material prepared by governments, but activist groups, companies, religious 
> organizations and the media can also produce propaganda.

But these are the obvious and egregious examples that we have learned to spot. 
This is the same reason why motivational posters in cooperate environments
don't work anymore. I doubt that the notorious "This is your brain on drugs" 
public service announcement had any serious effect. It's badly acted, it's 
nonsensical and the message it to much on the nose. 

But modern propaganda is way more subtle, more refined and in many case more 
entertaining. These are pieces of media that well crafted, generally work
within or close to the realm of a factual representation and contain just 
enough divergent viewpoints to make it seem like it is unbiased and objective.

I am not talking about the so called documentaries that are handing around 
our favorite streaming services, where you can clearly see the agenda. I know
some may see them as educational, but that is just confirming your biases.
I am talking about something like the movie "The Queen":

The Queen is a biographic drama that was released to cinemas in 2006. It follows
the British royal family and especially the Queen Elisabeth II through the 
events after the death of Diana. Although somewhat critical, the movie tries to 
humanize the Queen. Although her official appearance is quite cold and reserved,
the movie hints at her being a loving grandmother that tries to ease the pain
for her two grandchildren, the two princes William and Harry. Her seeming lack of
\empathy comes from the fact that she born in a different era, one where 
you just did not publicly show emotions.

Because the movie is rather intimate, there is no way of knowing if anything in 
the movie is anything close to teh through. But the movie is sufficiently 
critical and plausible that we can assume that in general terms it is accurate. 

An that is the key trick here, the content is plausible and that opens us to 
accept the content and their presentation. It makes us more empathic to the
queen and the monarchy in general. Something that was quite necessary, since
in Britain around 1990, about half wanted to get rid of the monarchy. 

Did it work? I don't want to claim that this movie was the sole influence, but
there is a clear uptick in favor for the queen in recent years. Unfortunately 
my after all of the 5 minutes of research I could not find any good numbers 
that would allow a before and after comparison. 

I would say, with the exception of totally escapist fiction, almost all pieces 
of modern media try to "sell" some kind of narrative and influence it's 
audience. The ones where it is obvious are just badly executed. 

And it is no wonder that a movie about the worst civilian nuclear incident is 
released in the year that acceptance has just tilted back favoring nuclear power.
